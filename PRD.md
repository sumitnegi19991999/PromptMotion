## ðŸŽ¬ PromptMotion: AI-Powered Manim Video Generator

### 1. Product Overview

PromptMotion enables users to generate educational, technical animations through natural language prompts. By leveraging AI (LLMs) to write Manim scripts and running them securely in Docker, users can go from prompt to MP4 video without any animation or programming expertise. All interactions happen through a clean web interface.

### 2. Goals & Objectives

**Vision**
Make technical explanations as accessible and visual as a whiteboard drawing, powered entirely by AI.

**6â€“12 Month Objectives**

- Generate â‰¥â€¯1,000 user-submitted scenes
- <â€¯60 seconds average render time per scene
- â‰¥â€¯95% successful render rate
- â‰¥â€¯100 active creators giving regular feedback

### 3. Target Users

**Primary Users**

- Technical educators (e.g., YouTubers, instructors)
- Developers creating explainers in ML, networking, system design

**Secondary Influencers**

- Students using these videos to learn
- Startup founders or blogs embedding explainer videos

---

### 4. Key Features (MoSCoW Framework)

**Must-Have**

- Prompt â†’ Manim code generation (via GPT/OpenAI API)
- Docker-based sandboxed rendering pipeline
- Video preview and download functionality
- User history of generated scenes

**Should-Have**

- Editable Manim code editor
- Text-to-speech integration (voiceover)
- Publicly shareable links

**Could-Have**

- Scene timeline stitching for multi-part animations
- Background music or transitions
- PWA or native mobile app support

**Wonâ€™t-Have (for MVP)**

### 5. Technical Requirements

- **Frontend:** React + TailwindCSS + CodeMirror (code view)
- **Backend:** Node.js for API + Python (Manim engine)
- **Execution:** Docker containers for script safety and isolation
- **Storage:** S3 or Supabase (videos); Firestore/PostgreSQL (metadata)
- **Security:** No internet access inside containers, resource limits, timeouts, logging
- **Performance:** Max 60s response per render; background job queuing system

---

### 6. UX/UI Design Requirements

- **Design Principles:** Simple, developer-friendly, visual-first

- **Accessibility:** Keyboard nav, readable fonts, alt-text & captions

- **UI Flow:**

  1. Input prompt (e.g., "Show cache miss from client to DB")
  2. Display generated Manim script (optional edit)
  3. User clicks "Render"
  4. Show rendered video with download/share options

- **Visual Style:** Dark mode default, soft purples and blues, monospace for code

---

### 7. Launch Plan

**MVP Scope**

- Natural language â†’ Manim â†’ video
- Basic history + rendering logs
- Focus on desktop-first web experience

**Beta Testing**

- 20â€“30 handpicked creators (via Discord, Twitter)
- Iterate based on real-world script failures and UI friction

**Timeline**

- **Month 1â€“2:** Docker render pipeline + API integration
- **Month 3:** React frontend MVP
- **Month 4:** Closed beta
- **Month 5â€“6:** Public launch with light marketing push

### 9. Risks & Mitigations

| Risk Type   | Description                       | Mitigation Strategy                        |
| ----------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Technical   | Malicious or infinite scripts     | Docker sandboxing + resource limits        |
| Performance | Render bottlenecks with load      | Prebuilt container layers + job queueing   |
| Market      | Too niche (only educators use it) | Partner with online creators & communities |
| Cost        | High compute for long scenes      | Rate limits, pricing tiers (post-MVP)      |
| Adoption    | Output quality isn't clear enough | Code previews + editable scenes            |
